        Kiwis are nocturnal and snuffle about the beach at night. When you track an element with Kiwi Runner, Kiwi Runner does exactly the same. Well... not exactly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Kiwi runner will snuffle the internet once a day (just after midnight, Pacific time), visit your site in the dead of night, and and take note of how the data in the element you're tracking has changed (if at all). It'll then save that data to our database and you'll have access to it whenever you like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kiwis are social! Feel free to share your kiwi findings with your friends! If they're popular, you might raise a top-trending kiwi! You'll have to make an account for this... click here to get started.
